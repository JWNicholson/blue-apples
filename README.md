### What it does
Th user types into the search input. Clicking the search button queries the omdapi.com api for any movie with those words in the title.

The results are shown on cards by mapping the results from the api call.
When user clicks More Info button, the state used to show/hid the section is changed, and the second api is called, which has more detailed information. That result is mapped into a section of a card.
